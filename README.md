# Personal dotfiles

I have two arch installs now, one on laptop and one on my desktop. Having to
set up everything for the fresh desktop arch install took too long, so this
is a central hub for my dotfiles to see at any time what I'm doing where and
why. Hopefully the next linux install I make won't take 5 days like this one
did. I'd like to get to a working computer slightly faster next time please!

At some point I would also like to have a personal step-by-step guide to 
achieve each install, mostly stuff that isn't covered by packages or 
dotfiles, but actions.
